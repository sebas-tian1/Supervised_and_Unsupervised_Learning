# Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Learning

This is a repository where i've tried to apply multiple supervised and unsupervised learning into the simplest dataset.

This repository also includes Ensemble Learning (Voting Classifier, Bagging, and Pasting), Boosting (AdaBoost and GradientBoosting(XGBoost)), Random Forest, and also Dimention Reduction (PCA, Kernel_PCA, LDA).

In this repository, I've also added an introduction to Deep Learning (with Keras) 

[There will be more projects and explanation about Deep Learning in the future].

In this repository is also a file that contains the code to Kaggle House Price Prediction Competition, which placed 1350/4296 (after submission). That code is far from perfection there are multiple ways to make the model better.
