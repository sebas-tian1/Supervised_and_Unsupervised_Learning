# Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Learning

This is a repository where i've tried to apply multiple supervised and unsupervised learning into the simplest dataset.

This repository also includes Ensemble Learning (Voting Classifier, Bagging, and Pasting), Boosting (AdaBoost and GradientBoosting(XGBoost)), and also Dimention Reduction (PCA, Kernel_PCA, LDA).

In this repository, I've also added an introduction to Deep Learning (with Keras) 

[There will be more projects and explanation about Deep Learning in the future].
